Version 0.16.1: Thu Sep 16 2004
- Added missing inc/ dependency

Version 0.16.0: Wed Sep 15 2004
- Fixed stdin_tell_bug.t so that it's more platform-dependent. (Martin Thurn
  <martin.thurn@ngc.com> reports that Solaris 2.8 returns 0 instead of -1).
- Added filehandle-specific input_record_separator capability (Feature
  suggestion by David Muir Sharnoff <muir@idiom.com>)
- Changed Makefile.PL to use Module::Install

Version 0.15:
- Switched from WeakRef to Scalar::Util, which is included in recent versions
  of Perl. (Thanks to Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net> for the suggestion and
  patch.)
- Fixed a bug involving pipes and tell(), where tell() would cause following
  operations to fail. (Thanks to Karol Szafranski <szafrans@imb-jena.de> for
  the bug report.)
- Added new_from_fd support (Thanks to Karol Szafranski <szafrans@imb-jena.de>
  for the bug report.)
- Fixed a bug in which <$fh> would always behave as if called in a list
  context after the first such call.

Version 0.14:
- Fixed an incompatibility with perl 5.6.1 and Data::Dumper. (Thanks to Jason
  Brunette <jbrunette@users.sourceforge.net> for the bug report and patch.)
- Fixed a bug in the seek.t test case which would cause failure on Windows
  (Thanks to rurban@x-ray.at for the bug report.)
- Fixed a memory leak. (Thanks to Jason Brunette
  <jbrunette@users.sourceforge.net> for taking the time to not only file the
  bug report, but also do a lot of work to track down the cause.) For now I'm
  using WeakRef to deal with circular references. If anyone can tell me how to
  get rid of them entirely I'd be grateful. See the discussion here:
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=892742&group_id=93038&atid=602891

Version 0.13:
- Added detection for a case in which a Perl bug will be exercised on Windows.
  Also added a test case (binmode_bug.t) to demonstrate it. See the BUGS
  section of the documentation.
- Added a couple new test cases.

Version 0.12:
- Changed the filehandle detection scheme so that filehandles created using
  Symbol::gensym would be detected correctly. (Thanks to Tassilo von Parseval
  <tassilo.parseval@post.rwth-aachen.de> for finding the bug)
- Fixed a bug in getline and getlines which would cause the routines to not
  return undef at the end of the file. (Thanks to Tassilo von Parseval
  <tassilo.parseval@post.rwth-aachen.de> for finding the bug)
- Fixed a potential bug in seek which would cause the module to not intercept
  the seek call following a previous seek call with an invalid whence
  parameter.

Version 0.11:
- Fixed uninitialized value warnings
- Create SourceForge project

Version 0.10:
- Initial version
