Version 0.12:

  Symbol::gensym would be detected correctly. (Thanks to Tassilo von Parseval
  <tassilo.parseval@post.rwth-aachen.de> for finding the bug)
- Fixed a bug in getline and getlines which would cause the routines to not
  return undef at the end of the file. (Thanks to Tassilo von Parseval
  <tassilo.parseval@post.rwth-aachen.de> for finding the bug)

  the seek call following a previous seek call with an invalid whence
  parameter.
