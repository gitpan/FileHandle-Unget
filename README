FileHandle::Unget - A FileHandle which supports ungetting of multiple bytes

FileHandle::Unget is a drop-in replacement for FileHandle which allows more
than one byte to be placed back on the input. It supports an ungetc(ORD) which
can be called more than once in a row, and an ungets(SCALAR) which places a
string of bytes back on the input.


NEW IN THIS VERSION

Version 0.16.0: Wed Sep 15 2004
- Fixed stdin_tell_bug.t so that it's more platform-dependent.
- Added filehandle-specific input_record_separator capability
- Changed Makefile.PL to use Module::Install


MODULE DEPENDENCIES
 
To use this module, you will need to install:

- Scalar::Util

You should be prompted to install this module automatically when you run "perl
Makefile.PL".


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you unarchived this
distribution and type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You will be prompted for installation locations. You can suppress these
prompts by specifying either "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation
into a custom location), "INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into
site-specific Perl directories), or "INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into
standard Perl directories).

If you make the installation into your own directory, then remember that you
must tell perl where to search for modules before trying to 'use' them. For
example:

  use lib '/home/userid/lib';
  use CGI::Cache;

If make test fails, please see the INSTALLATION PROBLEMS section below.


INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

If "make test" fails, run

  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email the results to the address
below, or submit a bug report on the project website as described in the
section REPORTING BUGS below.

For other bugs, see the section REPORTING BUGS below.


SECURITY NOTE

On Windows, this module will use a temporary file to decompress a file handle
when necessary. This could pose a security risk.


DOCUMENTATION

Just "perldoc FileHandle::Unget". After installation on Unix systems,
you can also do "man FileHandle::Unget".
