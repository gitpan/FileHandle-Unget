FileHandle::Unget - A FileHandle which supports ungetting of multiple bytes

FileHandle::Unget is a drop-in replacement for FileHandle which allows more
than one byte to be placed back on the input. It supports an ungetc(ORD) which
can be called more than once in a row, and an ungets(SCALAR) which places a
string of bytes back on the input.

DEPENDENCIES

No non-standard modules are required.


INSTALLATION

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

The "perl Makefile.PL" command will prompt you for an installation location if
you run it interactively, and will use the default values if it is run
non-iteractively. You will be asked to select the locations of certain
external compression programs.

You can force it to run non-interactively by specifying the following:

- either "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom
  location), "INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl
  directories), or "INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl
  directories).

If make test fails, please see the INSTALLATION PROBLEMS section below.


INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

If "make test" fails, run

  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email the results to the address
below, or submit a bug report on the project website as described in the
section REPORTING BUGS below.

For other bugs, see the section REPORTING BUGS below.


DOCUMENTATION

Just "perldoc FileHandle::Unget". After installation on Unix systems,
you can also do "man FileHandle::Unget".
